                <h3>About Me:</h3>
                <p style="float: left;">My name is David Johnson. I am a junior software engineer at Texas A&M University and
                I am minoring in cyber security and math. Some people might describe me as handsome or 
                funny, but all grandmothers say that to their grandchildren. My hobbies include games, of 
                the video and board variety, as well as reading. My favorite subjects in school are coding 
                math, if my minors didn't already give that away. A fun fact about me is that I am a fifth 
                generation Texan and I pay an organization thousands of dollars to teach myself. I currently
                work part-time at Andy's Frozen custard to afford college and I am excited to step into Industry.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3> Why Me?</h3>
                I would be a great fit for any company because I am personable and adaptable. Past employers
                have praised my ability to pick up the job and get the work done efficiently. I learn best by 
                being involved and doing the work hands on and I look forward to applying that in the industry
                setting. My education at Texas A&M speaks of my capability of, if nothing else, my
                ability to be trained and work in a high level setting. I look forward to being able to work in a
                close team who supports each other and tackles problems together.
