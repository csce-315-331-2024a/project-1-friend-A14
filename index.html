                <h3>About Me:</h3>
                <p style="float: left;">My name is David Johnson and I am from <a href="https://www.cibolotx.gov">Cibolo Texas</a>, near San Antonio. I am a
                    junior computer engineer at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html"> Texas A&M University</a> and I am minoring in cyber security and math. Some
                    people might describe me as handsome or funny, but all grandmothers say that to their grandchildren.
                    My hobbies include games, of both the video and board variety, as well as reading. My favorite
                    subjects in school are coding and math, if my minors didn't already give that away. Some fun facts
                    about me are that I am a fifth generation Texan, I pay an organization thousands of dollars to
                    teach myself, and I am the middle of three children. I currently work part-time at <a href="https://locations.eatandys.com/ll/US/TX/College-Station/104-Southwest-Pkwy">Andy's Frozen
                     Custard</a> to afford college and I am excited to step into Industry. My experience is in back end
                      development but I am interested in learning about other aspects too.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3> Why Me?</h3>
                <p>I would be an amazing hire for any company because I am personable and adaptable. Past employers
                 have praised my ability to pick up any new position and get the work done efficiently. I have been a
                 prime candidate to be cross trained and moved around where needed. I like to get to know and understand
                 my coworkers as we work together and I can be charming when needed. I learn best by being involved and
                 doing the work hands on, which I look forward to applying in the industry setting. Being immersed in the
                 work with somebody to advise against mistakes is how I thrive. My education at Texas A&M speaks of my
                 capability, if nothing else, my ability to be trained and work in a high level setting. I look forward
                 to being able to work in a close team that supports each other and tackles problems together.</p>
