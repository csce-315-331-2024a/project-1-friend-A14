        <h3>Story</h3>
        <p>In the desolate remains of a once-thriving world, nature had claimed its victory. Towering skyscrapers, now nothing more than skeletons,
             were cloaked in vines and moss. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth, and the only sounds were the whispers of the wind
             through the ancient overgrown ruins. <br>

            Among the crumbling structures, a lone wanderer named Aria roamed, navigating the maze of forgotten memories. Her steps echoed through 
            the silent corridors of the past, where remnants of a bygone era lay entwined with nature's reclamation. <br>
            
            As she ventured deeper into the heart of the ruins, Aria discovered an ornate doorway hidden beneath a cascade of ivy. With a sense of 
            trepidation, she pushed the overgrowth aside and entered a chamber untouched by time. In its center stood a dilapidated fountain, its 
            basin now a haven for ferns and delicate flowers. <br>
            
            Aria marveled at the murals adorning the chamber's walls, depicting a thriving civilization that had once reveled in technological 
            marvels. It was a stark contrast to the reality that surrounded her. In the midst of this post-apocalyptic world, she found herself 
            standing in a sanctuary untouched by decay. <br>
            
            As she continued exploring, Aria stumbled upon a weathered book lying open on a stone pedestal. Its pages revealed the stories of those
             who had once inhabited this place—their dreams, achievements, and the catastrophic event that brought about their downfall. <br>
            
            With a heavy heart, Aria absorbed the tales of a lost era. She realized that the overgrown ruins were not just remnants of destruction 
            but silent witnesses to the resilience of life. In the midst of desolation, nature had woven a tapestry of survival, turning the 
            once-mighty structures into a sanctuary of rebirth. <br>
            
            Leaving the chamber, Aria emerged into the sunlight filtering through the canopy of leaves overhead. As she continued her journey 
            through the ancient overgrown ruins, she carried with her the stories of a forgotten world—a world that had crumbled, but where the 
            indomitable spirit of life persisted among the echoes of its former glory. <br>
