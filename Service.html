        <h3>Current</h3>
        <p>Currently I provide services to the world by existing. This is because I am a damn delight and a freaking ray of sunshine. 
            The world is a better place soley because I exist. You're welcome. 
        </p>
        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>In the future once I have a stable income and can provide for myself, I do plan on expanding my public services. I want to give
            to my church as well as promote mental health.
